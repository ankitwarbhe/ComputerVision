# Computer Vision - Object Detection with OpenCV and Python 

## Introduction
Provide an introduction to the concept of object detection in computer vision. Explain its significance and applications.

## Tools and Libraries
#### OpenCV
Explain what OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is and why it's used for object detection.

#### Python
Discuss why Python is chosen as the programming language for this project.

#### NumPy
Mention NumPy's role in handling numerical operations and data structures, which is crucial for preprocessing and handling data in object detection tasks.

## Implementation Details
#### Preprocessing
Discuss any preprocessing steps applied to the input data (e.g., resizing, normalization).

#### Object Detection Script
Walk through the implementation of the object detection script:

##### Loading the Model: Explain how to load the pre-trained model.
##### Running Inference: Detail the process of running inference on input images or videos.
##### Postprocessing: Describe any postprocessing steps applied to the detected objects (e.g., filtering, non-maximum suppression).

## Example Code Snippets
Provide code snippets from your implementation to illustrate key points.

## Performance Evaluation
Discuss how you evaluated the performance of your object detection model. Include metrics used and results obtained.

## Usage Tips
Offer practical tips for using your implementation effectively.

## Future Improvements
Discuss potential improvements or extensions to your project (e.g., using different models, optimizing performance).

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points discussed and highlight the significance of your project in the context of object detection and computer vision.
